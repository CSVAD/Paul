I chose to implement a playful interface with color and shapes. The intended audience I guess could be anyone wanting to have some fun with shapes and color. Primarily, there are two shapes I start with, a rectangle and a circle. User is exposed to a dropdown menu to select which of these two shapes they would want to add to the interface. Once selected, you can see the shape rapidly changing color and you can drag one out of that and place on the canvas. I would have liked to add more shapes but since I am travelling, I kind of ran out of time. The users are tightly constrained in terms of controlling the dimensions of the shape that are generated. I chose to do so to ensure one giant shape doesnt cover up the screen.
