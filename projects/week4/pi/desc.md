Carrying on with the parametric shape I had made during the week 3 homework, I incorporated particles as a form of noise for the task in homework 4. The idea came from the vase/container like shape that my parametric designs had. I thought it would look nice if I could add something like a bubbles or fume coming out of the vase. Perlin noise didnt quite have that sort of effect, same as Gaussian. The simple particle design made by Daniel Shiffman however seemed perfect. I incorporated that into my parametric design and added the features of user selecting whether they wanted the particles and the number of particles that would be forming.
