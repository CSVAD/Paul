For this project, I chose to implement a Wirless Network Emulator. Usually in the field of network engineering, you want to analyse algorithms such as network selection when a phone has the choice of selecting one form of access technology over another. In my network simulator, I have 3 types of access technologies: 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi. First the base stations for each of these techs are placed around the device by pressing one of the three keys. The network selection algorithm then decides which of the 3 techs is idea for connection at a point in time. My placement algorithm is just making use of the random function but I was impressed by how flexible and easy to use the drawingmanager library is even for developing highly technical tools. 

PS: I had an issue with exporting it to pdf. Not quite sure why.
