I implemented couple of motions into a library to be used in Processing. The goal in esscence was to create a suite that encloses all sorts of motions affiliated features into a library. Due to the time constraint, I could only implement 2 features: 1. linear motion and 2. bouncing ball. Anyone using the library could easily alter its parameters through either a public method drawLinear(to draw linear motion) or drawBouncy(to draw bouncing ball). By changing the variables, desired shape could be drawn.
