Drawing inspiration from the vase we worked with in class, in my design i implemented a shape selector that allows the user to select several shapes by using a slider. The slider value triggers various modifications to the sine function that was presented during our last lecture. For my design, I allowed the user to choose upto six different shapes, each being a product of the formula. In addition, through the interface, I also made provision for the user to select the thickness of the vase, depending on the chosen shape. This provision is also achieved using a slider.
