I was quite intrigued to witness how the plotter, a device that only goes in 2 directions, would be able to draw my design of a funnel which has some sort of depth to it. When it started out plotting the design, it looked nothing like how the design on the screen looked. Gradually, the shape emerged and in the end it was just perfect. In that regard, I would say I did not quite encounter any specific constraints in terms of design. I did not experiment with fill so that probably would be one aspect that would impose some degree of constraint.
