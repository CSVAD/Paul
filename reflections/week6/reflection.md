In Instrumental Instruction, Michel does a great job in covering the then current literatire in the field of user interface. It was interesting to read about a system such as WIMP that has been around for so long and has stood the test of time. He highlights the inherent differences between direct and instrumental interaction. His comparison of both WIMP and post-WIMP interaction techniques were also quite insightful.

Toby in Alternative Programming Interfaces for Alternative Programmers, Toby draws attention to the fact that people from diverse backgrounds are now using programming to achieve their goals. He introuces the concept of Recursive Drawing. He presents the work that actually motivated him to create this new interface tool. Direct manipulation of the output to actually change the source code is indeed a very useful tool for people who lack the programming background but are interested in leveraging the power of programming to create art.
