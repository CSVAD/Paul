In the article "Some Reflections on Designing Construction Kits for Kids", I really liked the attention paid by the authors on the design principles and how they mention they didnt just implement one principle after another but rather kept them in mind while making the kits. Second thing that struck me was something Jennifer replied when I presented this question during one of our discussion: "When do you consider an art work to be done?" to which she replied "There is no done in real sense with these works". The authors of this piece mentioned something similar and I get the point of view much better now.
