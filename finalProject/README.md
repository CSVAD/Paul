For this final project, Alex and I will be exploring the possibility of fusing different genres of artwork using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The idea behind this is to understand what it would be like if two different artists with diverse style and choices produced an artpiece. Thanks to generative art algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we can now mix and match various styles to see if something truly unique and/or amazing can be produced. We envision playing with various genres such as abstract, graffiti and mosaic amongst others. We will also look into combining artworks of famous artists. We will build our custom data set based on our requirement by scraping useful websites such as wikiart.org. We will also evaluate results produced by the generative algorithms and present the outputs that are most interesting for discussion.
